- âš½ My hobbies: football, gym, listening to music, Formula 1

	ðŸ“– My biggest projects:

- Simple banking app in Java, I learned a lot about object oriented programming, debugging code, good programming practices
- Antivirus in C++, using CMake build system, hashing files with SHA-256 and encrypting them with AES cipher
- Writing kernel module communicating with user through proc-fs filesystem, this helped me to understand what is a kernel, how to write simple verilog modules and involved some C programming.
