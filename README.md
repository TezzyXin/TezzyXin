- 👋 Hi, I’m Kuba, I study Cybersecurity of Warsaw University of Technology,
- 👀 I’m looking for an internship in Warsaw to develop skills in Cybersecurity, programming, DevOps or similar
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about operating systems, CI/CD 
- ⚽ My hobbies: football, gym, listening to music, Formula 1

	📖 My biggest projects:

- Simple banking app in Java, I learned a lot about object oriented programming, debugging code, good programming practices
- Antivirus in C++, using CMake build system, hashing files with SHA-256 and encrypting them with AES cipher
- Writing kernel module communicating with user through proc-fs filesystem, this helped me to understand what is a kernel, how to write simple verilog modules and involved some C programming.
- IDEA cipher written in Java, in this I learned some maths, how to read a documentation
